# koryki.ai/core

koryki.ai/core library improves the interaction of business users with relational databases for searches and data analysis 
assisted by Large Language Models (LLM)
to translate natural language to machine-executable statements.

By introducing an easy-to-understand and easily verifiable query language (KQL), the user remains in the driver's seat.
Build trustworthy and reliable systems to get verifiable results. 

![reduce uncertainty by introduction of kql](doc/shift_control.svg)

KQL avoid ambiguities and redundancy of SQL, it has a tiny small grammar and is therefore easy to learn. 

Further measures to reduce complexity users are faced during data-analysis:

- introducing a business model on top of database schema using business terms instead of exposing database internals.
- labeling entity relations to hide join criteria
- hide database techniques for optimization, like partitioned tables, function-based indexes,
  precalculated values like soundex, etc.

Each step of abstraction with determined processing reduces complexity visible to users and LLMs.
These determined processing can be handled by SQL-Generation in a reliable way.
This yields to reduction of complexity users need to understand and validate. It also reduces effort to LLMs to calculate.



Beyond syntax checks, there is no such thing as 'right' or 'wrong' about a query. It all depends on the user's needs and expectations. Assisting the user to truly understand system behavior is most important
to increase productivity and quality in data analysis.

# MCP-Server

With the help of the koryki.ai MCPâ€“Server, users can gain read access to databases with the support of an AI-model, see
[Model-Context-Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro "(MCP)").

![MCP-Server Overview](doc/mcp_overview.png)



The primary task of the koryki.ai MCP-Server is to bridge the gap between simplified queries easy to use by humans and
AI models and the formal languages for relational databases (SQL).

Easy to use implies:
- easy to read and write by humans and AI-models,
  brief and clear,
  focus on essentials, use terms of the business domain, skip details humans have in mind or AI-models know from context or simply need not know.
- easy to understand and validate by humans.

For this purpose, two query languages are introduced:
* **kql**: korykiai query language aims to formulate queries in an easily understandable form.
* **iql**: intermediate query language serves the purpose of supplementing queries with technical information using rule sets. This language takes the implicit expectations of users into account. Details required by databases but irrelevant to users are introduced here.


After the AI model has converted the natural language query into **kql**-form,
the koryki.ai MCP-server converts this query into **iql**-form,
enriches and transforms the query using rule sets, and finally generates the SQL
appropriate for the database system.


### Let's have a look on a sample:

User enters:

    Find customers who have placed more than 10 orders in January 2023,
    return companyname and count, sort by count.

With the help of published resources about koryki.ai, **kql** and the entity-relationship model
AI may create a query in **kql**-form:

    FIND customers c, c-orders o
    WHERE count(o) > 10 AND 
        o.order_date BETWEEN DATE '2023-01-01' AND DATE '2023-01-31'
    RETURN c.company_name, count(o)
    ORDER count(o) DESC

The same query in **iql**:

    SELECT
        "customers" "c"
            OUT "c"."company_name" 1
            GROUP "c"."company_name"
        JOIN "orders" "o"
            OUT count("o"."order_id") 2
            FILTER "o"."order_date" BETWEEN DATE '2023-01-01' AND DATE '2023-01-31'
            HAVING count("o"."order_id") > 10
            ORDER count("o"."order_id") DESC
        OWNER


Applied rules:
1. resolve WHERE-Clause in FILTER or HAVING, in dependence of aggregation
2. add GROUP-BY-Clause where required
3. resolve primary-key columns for identity in count function

Join-Clauses are still not resolved to Join-Columns.

The same query in SQL, resolved join-columns:

    SELECT
        c.company_name
    ,   count(o.order_id)
    FROM
        customers c
        INNER JOIN orders o ON
            c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    WHERE
        o.order_date BETWEEN DATE '2023-01-01' AND DATE '2023-01-31'
    GROUP BY
        c.company_name
    HAVING
        count(o.order_id) > 10
    ORDER BY
        count(o.order_id) DESC



But at least there are two more requirements we have to care about:

- building a trustworthy system
    - restrict access to granted areas only
    - deliver accurate results
    - avoid misuse, esp. sql-injection
- best possible response times
